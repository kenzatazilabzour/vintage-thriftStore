# Vintage Thrift Store Web App

Welcome to the Vintage Thrift Store Web App.

## Introduction
Virtual Thrift Store is a web application that allows users to buy and sell secondhand clothing and accessories. Users can add items to their cart, negotiate prices, and complete purchases.


## Features
The application includes token-based authentication for user registration, login, and logout. Certain routes and features are restricted to authenticated users. You can further customize the authorization logic based on user roles (e.g., admin and regular users).

In addition to the core features, you can implement additional functionality, such as:

Integration with a third-party API to fetch data.
User roles and permissions.
Dynamic UI elements and data visualization.
